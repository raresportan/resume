- In 2018, after so many years at Saguaro Print, I decided to join 3PillarGlobal Timisoara and work as Technical Lead for React-based projects.

- On the first project, I've designed and partially implemented a small app done with React and Node.js backend. The app was deployed on AWS. Since it was a small project, we managed to have 100% code coverage for unit tests. *(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, Koa.js, AWS, REST, Jest, Enzyme)*

- Working as UI Lead( UI team of five) on a website implemented with React/Gatsby and Java backend. The client is a subscriber-based media company and requires a constant redesign of the vital features. *(HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, React, Gatsby, REST, GraphQL, Jest, Enzyme, Testing library)*
