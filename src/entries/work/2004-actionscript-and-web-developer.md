- A Saguaro I've maily worked on web apps that provide workflow management of industrial printing. Industrial printing (done with room size printers) is incredible challenging. Initially these apps were form intensive and with no visual previewing, but in time they became visualization heavy.


- First I've worked on a Java Spring application, UI renders with JSPs. Our local small team designed and implemented the whole thing. It was a great experience and proof that I can design software.

- I became UI Lead( UI team of five) and I designed and did part of the implementation of big application that had a Adobe Flex(ActionScript) UI and a Java backend. It provided a complex interactive vizualization and animations, like a book you could flip through, a book with different page sizes, colors, foldings etc. 

- Again as UI Lead( UI teams of five-ten) I designed and did part of the implementation of a several applications that had an Angular.js/Angular UI and a Java backend. Some provided again complex interactive vizualization like before, some were running in AWS.
*(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular.js/Angular, AWS, REST)*

- Code design and implementation was done based on meetings with stakeholders. We did demos and provided working prototypes to proof or test the implementation.

- Did several trainings inside the company: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Angular.js. Helped team members integrate, upskill and work better. I failed only once with one person.
