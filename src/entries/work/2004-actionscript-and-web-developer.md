- A Saguaro I've mainly worked on web apps that provide workflow management of industrial printing. Industrial printing (done with room-size printers) is incredibly challenging. Initially, these apps were form-intensive and with no visual previewing, but in time they became visualization heavy.


- First, I've worked on a Java Spring application, UI renders with JSPs. Our local (and small) team designed and implemented the whole thing. It was a great experience and proof that I can design software.

- I became UI Lead( UI team of five), and I designed and did part of the implementation of a big application that had an Adobe Flex(ActionScript) UI and a Java backend. It provided a complex interactive visualization and animations, like a book you could flip through, a book with different page sizes, colors, foldings, etc. 

- Again as UI Lead( UI teams of five-ten) I designed and did part of the implementation of several applications that had an Angular.js/Angular UI and a Java backend. Some provided again complex interactive visualization like before, some were running in AWS.
*(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular.js/Angular, AWS, REST)*

- Code design and implementation were done based on meetings with stakeholders. We did demos and provided working prototypes to prove or test the implementation.

- Did several training sessions inside the company: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular.js. Helped team members integrate, upskill and work better. I failed only once with one person.
